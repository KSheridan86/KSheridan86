## Experience

### 2022 - Present

In 2022, I started a Web Design business with the intention of expanding my skills and helping clients achieve their online business goals and increasing their digital presence. To date, I have helped a craft bakery expand its reach and I have built a fully functional E-Commerce site for a local Sculptor. This has meant a growth in visibility and revenue as he is no longer relying solely on foot traffic at markets and social media interest.

### 2007 - 2021

From 2007 to 2021, I worked at CIE as a bus driver. This highly responsible job involved ensuring the safety of hundreds of people on a day-to-day basis, as well as providing an elevated level of customer service. I collaborated with multiple different departments across the country, including maintenance, inspectors, health and safety, clerical, and human resources, to ensure the smooth operation of a nationwide service.
